# entropy_of_card_decks
A quick notebook explaining the 2nd law of thermodynamics using small decks of cards.

Here we have two (very small) decks of cards, kept separate, and we look at the number of ways of arranging them.

We then mix the two decks and see that the number of ways of arranging them is much, much greater.  

The two decks can represent two separate systems.
